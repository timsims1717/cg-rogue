Story
======================================

Each playable character is the same person from different alternate realities. One of their versions is the bad guy.

======================================

The Runner (Jake or Jane Peril):
	No Defense, but nearly all cards have Movement
	No Damage, except for Bombs
	Lots of Traps
	Good at collecting Gold
	Bonuses for collecting Gold

The Hoplite:
	Strong Defense and Attack
	Really good at boosting Allies at close range

======================================
Progression System
======================================
Each character levels up by gaining experience. Experience is gained by:
	Killing Enemies
	Fulfilling Maneuvers (card specific objectives)
	Fulfilling Character Objectives
	Exploring the Map
	Gaining Gold
	Etc

Each playable character also has a bonus way to gain experience:
	Example: Runner: Gaining Gold is doubled/tripled
	Example: Wrestler: Comboing enemies (deal damage/grapple on each turn while not taking damage)
	Example: Hoplite: Defending self and allies

The power level of each card you earn/buy is partially determined by your current level (kinda like Minecraft Dungeons)

You can also maybe spend experience to level up your allies?
