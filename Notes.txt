======================================
Story
======================================

Each playable character is the same person from different alternate realities. One of their versions is the bad guy.


======================================
Possible Card Paradigms
======================================

While each of these is separated, there could be a combination of some kind

1. Character Specific Cards
	Each character would have between 25 and 50 cards
	There would be a number of neutral cards
	When selecting new cards, there would be one or two character specific, a neutral, and one full random
2. Equipment Specific Cards
	Each weapon and artifact would have between 5 and 15 cards
	There would be a number of neutral cards (not related to equipment)
	Equipment could be based on Character still (having some equipment be more or less common by character)
	What about combo cards, requiring a few different weapons/equipment to work. This would work as a sort of character specific, since each character would start with that combo. Combos would also encourage discovery! Maybe finding rapier + hand crossbow, ya know?
3. Stat Based Cards
	Certain cards are only playable if a character's stat is high enough
	Probably in combination with Equip based?


======================================
Possible Playable Characters
======================================

The Runner (Jake or Jane Peril):
	No Defense, but nearly all cards have Movement
	No Damage, except for Bombs
	Lots of Traps
	Good at collecting Gold
	Bonuses for collecting Gold

The Hoplite:
	Strong Defense and Attack
	Really good at boosting Allies at close range
	Desert Magic

The Surge:
	Wild Magic Surge

The Wrestler:
	Grappling
	Psychic Magic

Muscular Puncher:

======================================
Progression System
======================================
Each character levels up by gaining experience. Experience is gained by:
	Killing Enemies
	Fulfilling Maneuvers (card specific objectives)
	Fulfilling Character Objectives
	Exploring the Map
	Gaining Gold
	Etc

Each playable character also has a bonus way to gain experience:
	Example: Runner: Gaining Gold is doubled/tripled
	Example: Wrestler: Comboing enemies (deal damage/grapple on each turn while not taking damage)
	Example: Hoplite: Defending self and allies

The power level of each card you earn/buy is partially determined by your current level (kinda like Minecraft Dungeons)

You can also maybe spend experience to level up your allies?
